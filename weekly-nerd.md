# Leveraging Knowledge for Designers' Professional Growth

In the fast-paced world of design, continuous development and improvement are vital for designers to thrive. During the first weekly nerd I was able to attend, Deanna Bosschert, a graduate of CMD Amsterdam and currently working as a Software Engineer at Software Bastards and frontend developer at the Nationale Postcode Loterij, shared valuable insights on how designers can utilize their knowledge to enable better collaboration within teams.

One of the primary challenges for designers is finding a balance between delivering high-quality products and keeping up with design trends. Bosschert highlighted that while design education often equips designers with up-to-date knowledge, the priority in the industry lies in timely product delivery. Designers frequently find themselves working on existing projects, often facing multiple ad hoc requests.

## Streamlining Handoffs

To ensure efficient collaboration, Bosschert stressed the importance of well-defined handoff processes. She outlined four key handoff stages: Design, Content, Test, and Review. 

1. Design - design elements are typically shared through Zeplin and Invision links.
2. Content - content is provided in a separate copy document. 
3. Test - a dedicated tester then examines the design for any visual, copy, or functional errors.
4. Review - followed by a design acceptance test with marketers and designers during the review phase.

## Challenges in Design-to-Development Handoff

Bosschert shed light on the common hurdles encountered during the design-to-development handoff. Designers often provide their work without sufficient explanation on how components should function. Additionally, the lack of standardized formats (e.g., 4px - 8px - 16px) and inadequate file formats (e.g., png, webp) can pose significant challenges for developers. Furthermore, receiving images with incorrect cropping further complicates the handoff process.

### Consequences and Solutions

These challenges have several implications for development teams. Without clear instructions, developers may make incorrect technical decisions or deviate from the original design, resulting in additional time spent on conversion or clarification. Bosschert emphasized that designers who possess knowledge of the development process can take proactive steps to mitigate these issues. By actively participating in the design process, offering feedback, and maintaining open communication channels, designers can ensure that their work is delivered in the desired format, reducing the need for developers to seek clarifications.

## Harnessing Process Knowledge

Bosschert encouraged designers to leverage their understanding of the design and development processes to improve workflows. They should proactively identify opportunities for enhancement, drawing on their own experiences to suggest improvements. By being proactive and communicative, designers can establish a clear understanding of how they want their work to be delivered, fostering effective collaboration between design and development teams.

## Scheduling Regular Meetings
To facilitate collaboration, Bosschert recommended scheduling recurring meetings involving all relevant teams. These meetings provide a platform for discussing ongoing projects, addressing concerns, and aligning expectations. By consistently engaging with other team members, designers can establish a shared understanding and minimize potential bottlenecks.
