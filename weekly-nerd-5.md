# Project Fugu and the Future of Web Applications

During the fifth weekly nerd episode by Niels Leenheer showed us the world of Project Fugu. This Chromium project aims to bridge the gap between native apps and web applications by unlocking access to features previously limited to native environments.

## The Limitations of Web Applications

Niels began by acknowledging the limitations of web applications compared to their native counterparts. Due to security concerns, many functionalities and hardware interactions were restricted within web browsers, hindering the development of fully functional web applications. To overcome these limitations, developers often turned to frameworks like Electron to wrap websites within a native app, granting access to desired features.

## Introducing Project Fugu

Project Fugu, a part of the Chromium project, aims to close the gap between web and native applications. It achieves this by introducing a set of APIs that enable web applications to access hardware and system-level features, previously only available to native apps. The goal is to empower web developers to create more powerful and immersive applications that can rival their native counterparts.

## Enhanced Capabilities and Security

Niels highlighted the potential of Project Fugu to enable web applications to interact with hardware and system functionalities. This includes communication with devices such as Bluetooth-enabled lamps, for which Niels demonstrated changing the lamp's color using the Web Bluetooth API. While this added flexibility is exciting, Niels acknowledged the need for caution, as it introduces potential security risks. Web applications have limited permissions by default, requiring explicit user consent for accessing hardware and system capabilities. In contrast, native apps have more inherent control, but this also means they can potentially abuse their privileges.

## The Importance of Browsers

Niels emphasized that browsers play a crucial role in ensuring security and user trust. By providing a controlled environment where permissions and access are explicitly granted, browsers can offer a more secure platform for web applications compared to native apps. Niels stressed that it is essential to build trust in the browser ecosystem, as users often download and install native apps without scrutinizing their permissions, while browsers require explicit permission for each capability.
