The web used to be weirder. mission to bring back the spirit of the old web
there werent any rules

pre-social media, no rules, free static sites that people just built for funsies

nowadays everything looks the same --> too much into the 'minimalistic' direction

geocities

lets bring back the weird! experimental side of the web using the modern and accessible methods we have today

lots of animated gifs

wrote HTML in capitals

```hmtl
<IMG SRC="link">
```

dont autoplay gifs when users have specific settings on (reduce motion etc) u can add or respect this media query with picture/source elements in HTML

animated text effects don't belong in body text

[creating classic word heading art in css lol]

get text via data attribute in css
```css
content: attr(data-content);
```

DHTML Cursor trail

Go forth and build something weird!

## Adam Argyle (dude die robert leuk vind)  | Keep CSS Weird 

HSL, LCH

Lightness vs Luminance

hsl lightness is 50% but the perceptual lightness is wildly different

lch perceptual lightness is conssiten to human eyes. less vibrant but constant

hsl lying to us!! not actually 50% lightness

okLCH demo

```
oklch(99%, .05, 320);
// lightness, chroma?, hue
```
