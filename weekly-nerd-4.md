# Adapting to Reality - Aaron Gustafson (Seattle, Washington DC)

In the beginning -> 640 x 480 screen dimensions
So they built fixed websites for those screens -> not ideal!

As time progressed we got 800 x 600, but they still made de websites fixed width -> stinky

1024 x 768 (false sense of security)

Laptop sizes were all over the place and expensive! But they were ignoring mobiles

240x240 640x200 (mobile dimensions)

Until smartphones came along. So many different screen sizes, dimeensions and orientations -> Overwhelming! So we got media queries

Desktops today are much bigger! 1920x1080 etc etc

"Chasing screen sizes is clearly a fool's errand"

Your content can and will go anywhere that's connected:
- Wearables
- Smart TVs
- IoT
- Assistants

We need to think about all the different ways people will interact with our sites. Meaning useres will need to be able to interact in different ways:
- eye tracking
- t9
- touch
- mouse
- remote
- pen
- braille
- print
- keyboard
- audio
- gamepad

Over varied networks and changing conditions (different contexts)
- wifi
- hardline
- mobile
- homes
- buildings
- cars
- buses
- trains
- airplanes

And ultimately our users all have different needs too. A whole lot to consider, and this doesn't even include browsers!

Nothing about our users' experience of the web has ever been as homogenous as we imagined. (reality check)

Treat your ideal scenario as an edge case! Barely anyone is gonna have the perfect experience. We design for us, which is our flaw. We're limiting what users can experience and what they can make their own.

not all smartphones are equal! different devices have different specs. A different experience!

disabilities dont always have to be permanent, its also situational!

approach your job with an open mind and empathy for ur users
we try stuff make mistakes and learn from them

Step by step adapting to reality

1. Focus on what matters, the essential 'nugget' such as a heading
2. Write it out, then read it back. The words we use matter.
3. Look for semantics that support 1 & 2
Consider how your design choices impact the reading experience
Think about the many different ways folks might interact
Map the potential experiences (flowcharts)
Iterate
